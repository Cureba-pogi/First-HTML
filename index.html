<h1>Concepts of Rock Cycle and Volcanic Eruption</h1>
<p> <strong>Volcanic eruption</strong><br>
<lem>The concept behind the volcanic eruption is that the Earths core is highly contained with small amounts.<br> 
  of dissolved gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur which mostly contains oxygen and silicon which is a high temperature molten rocks.</lem></p>

<p>Due to the tectonic plate movements, which is divergent and convergent.<br>
It creates a scenario where two plates collides and splits, making a structure that is suitable for molten rocks to flow through on the Earths crust. <br>
  Convergent  moves the two tectonics plates collide at 1 another and divergent in the other hand breaks the 1 plate by splitting it, making it into 2 plates<br>
  which both plate tectonics leads to molten rocks to flow through.</p>
