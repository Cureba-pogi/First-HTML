<h1>Concepts of Rock Cycle and Volcanic Eruption</h1>
  <br>
<h2>Volcanic eruption</h2>
  <br>
 <h3>The concept behind the volcanic eruption is that the Earths core is highly contained with small amounts.<br> 
  of dissolved gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur which mostly contains oxygen and silicon which is a high temperature molten rocks.</h3>

<h3>Due to the tectonic plate movements, which is divergent and convergent.<br>
It creates a scenario where two plates collides and splits, making a structure that is suitable for molten rocks to flow through on the Earths crust. <br>
  Convergent  moves the two tectonics plates collide at 1 another and divergent in the other hand breaks the 1 plate by splitting it, making it into 2 plates<br>
  which both plate tectonics leads to molten rocks to flow through.</h3>

  <h3>Once the molten rocks squizes into the gap that the divergent and convergent plate tectonics made,<br> it squizes within the main vent and some of the molten rocks may tend to leak out of the secondary vent.     </h3>

  <h3>Once the molten rocks touches the surface of the Earth, It is now called a "lava" and when it solidifies due to the exposure of the atmosphere,<br> it is now called an "Igneous rock" and that's where the rock cycle starts.  </h3>
